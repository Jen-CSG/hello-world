# hello-world
Trying to refamiliarize myself with git

I used it a year ago for my d3 work for PSU.

I'm having trouble figuring out how to get the Merge Pull Request button to be enabled.

Now I'm adding lines. I want to see what a series of commits looks like.

Looks like I have to click on the commits button in order to see all my commits (sequentially).
